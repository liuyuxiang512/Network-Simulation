# Network-Simulation
Simulate a network environment and design a routing mechanism.

## Files
* adjacency_matrix.txt contains network topology.
* hw_all.cc will output all simulation results with many intermediate results.
* hw_clear.cc only outputs 4 indexes (max queue length, average time delay, average throughput, and average packet loss rate) into 4 dat files.

## How to run
***
./waf
./waf -run scratch/hw_clear
